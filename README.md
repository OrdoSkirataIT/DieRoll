# DieRoll
a C++ based die rolling program that takes user input of die size (d6, d8, d20, etc) and amount of rolls needed and outputs that many rolls of that die size. Can be exited at any time by inputting ctrl+z instead of a number.

Entering non-integers does break the program at this time.

If you want to contribute and know how to make GUIs, I'd love to give this a nice smooth look for user-friendliness.
